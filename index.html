          <h2>A Historic Achievement</h2>
          <p>The first manned Moon landing took place during NASA's Apollo 11 mission, marking one of the most significant events in the history of human space exploration. On July 20, 1969, astronauts Neil Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin, and Michael Collins carried out a mission that captivated millions across the globe. While Collins remained in orbit aboard the Command Module Columbia, Armstrong and Aldrin descended to the lunar surface in the Lunar Module Eagle.</p>
          
          <p>At 20:17 UTC, Armstrong reported the historic message: <span class="quote">"Houston, Tranquility Base here. The Eagle has landed."</span> Six hours later, Armstrong descended the ladder and stepped onto the Moon's surface, delivering the now-legendary words: <span class="quote">"That's one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind."</span> Millions of people around the world watched the event on black-and-white televisions, with the live broadcast carried via satellite to over 600 million viewers.</p>
          
          <p>This mission occurred during the Cold War, a period of political tension between the United States and the Soviet Union. The Moon landing was not only a scientific and technological triumph but also a demonstration of American innovation and determination in the context of the Space Race, which had begun years earlier when the Soviet Union launched Sputnik 1, the first artificial satellite, in 1957.</p>
          
          <p>The success of Apollo 11 was the result of years of preparation and the work of over 400,000 scientists, engineers, and technicians. The Saturn V rocket stood over 110 meters tall and remains the most powerful rocket ever built. The astronauts wore specially designed suits to protect them from extreme temperatures and lack of atmosphere. The onboard computers had less processing power than today's smartphones, yet they executed one of the most complex navigation operations in history.</p>

          <p>The Moon landing had a lasting effect on science, technology, and culture: it inspired generations to pursue careers in science and engineering, provided new scientific data, and symbolized the possibilities of human exploration beyond Earth. The footprints left by Armstrong and Aldrin will remain on the lunar surface for millions of years, as there is no wind or rain to erode them—a lasting monument to humanity's greatest journey.</p>

            <ul>
              <li>The lunar surface is covered in regolith, a fine dust that clung to the astronauts' suits.</li>
              <li>Armstrong and Aldrin spent about 21 hours on the Moon and collected over 21 kg of lunar material.</li>
              <li>A plaque was left on the Moon reading: <span class="quote">"We came in peace for all mankind."</span></li>
              <li>The mission traveled a distance of 240,000 miles from Earth to the Moon in just over three days.</li>
              <li>The American flag they planted was knocked over by the rocket blast when the lunar module departed.</li>

              <p>As spacecraft commander for Apollo 11, Armstrong gained the distinction of being the first person to land a craft on the Moon and the first to step on its surface.</p>
              <p>Before becoming an astronaut, Armstrong was an officer in the U.S. Navy and served in the Korean War. After the war, he earned his bachelor's degree from Purdue University and served as a test pilot at the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA).</p>
